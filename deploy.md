## What Happens During Deployment

1. **Build Process**:
   - Installs Node.js dependencies
   - Builds React frontend (`npm run build`)
   - Creates production-ready files

2. **Runtime**:
   - Starts Express server
   - Serves React app from `/dist` folder
   - Handles API requests at `/api/*` endpoints
   - SQLite database is created automatically

3. **Database**:
   - SQLite database is created on first run
   - Sample ingredients are automatically added
   - Data persists between deployments

## Environment Variables (Optional)

Railway/Render will automatically set:
- `PORT` - The port your app runs on
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"

## Monitoring Your App

### Railway Dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

2. **App won't start**: Check the start command is `npm start`
3. **Database errors**: SQLite will be created automatically on first run
4. **API not working**: Make sure routes are properly configured

### Getting Help:

- Verify your local build works: `npm run build && npm start`
- Check the README.md for more details

## Next Steps

After deployment:
1. **Test your app**: Make sure all features work
